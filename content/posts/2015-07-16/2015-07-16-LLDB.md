### build
Programs normally have to be compiled with a special option to allow debugging to take place. On UNIX, the option for clang++ is the -g option. For example
```
clang++ -Wall -g -o prog1 prog1.cpp 
```
We also include the -Wall option, which lists warnings (the 'all' is to list all warnings). Note that this option leads to executable files that are larger and slower, so you may not want to use it for final distributions or time-critical programs. But you can always remove the debugging information from an executable without recompiling it with the strip command. For more information on that, see the man page for strip (i.e., run man strip from the command line).

The -g option causes the compiler to include information about the source file (the .cpp file) that is needed for debugging as part of the executable file. This causes the executable to be larger in size, and slightly slower, but allows for debugging. So when you run the debugger, you specify the executable file (not the source file) as the input to the debugger.

###  Start Using lldb
```
lldb prog1
```

### Executing your Program
command-line arguments
```
run 100 test1.dat // prog1 100 test1.dat
```


### help
(lldb) help


### excution
```
(lldb)r / run
(lldb)s / step
(lldb)n / next
(lldb)c / continue
(lldb)si / ni
(lldb)finish  (finishes executing the current function and then pauses)
```

### break point
```
(lldb)b main(set a break at all function named main)
(lldb)b test.c:12
(lldb)b -[NSString stringWithFormat:]
(lldb)br s -S count /br set -SvtDataCenterFetchComplete:userData:
(lldb)br list
(lldb)br del [n]
```

### watch point
```
(lldb) watch set var -w write global_var(set write watchpoint)
(lldb) watch set exp -w write -- my_ptr(set write watchpoint in pointer)
(lldb) watch set var -w read global_var(set read watchpoint)
(lldb) watch modify -c '(global==5)' (set condition on watch point)
```

### examining variables
```
(lldb) frame variable (all the arguments and local variables )
(lldb) frame v -a (show local variables for current frame)
(lldb) frame v isChanged
(lldb) target v
(lldb) print a_var / po a_var
(lldb) display <var> (display that variable's value each time the program execution hits a breakpoint)
(lldb) display (show all display variable)
(lldb) undisplay
```

### Changing a Variable's Value
```
expr x = 5
```

### examining thread
```
(lldb) f(see current and surrounding lines)
(lldb) list (shows a listing of the source code where the breakpoint occurred)
(lldb) thread backtrace
(lldb) bt / backtrace
(lldb) up(select the stack frame that called the current stack frame)
(lldb) down(select the stack frame that is called by the current stack frame)
```

### executabe && shared library
```
(lldb) image list(list the main executable andall dependent shared libraries)
(lldb) image dump sections (dump all sectionsf rom the main executable and any sharedlibraries))
```


### exaples
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void my_subroutine() {
    cout << "Hello world" << endl;
}

int main() {
    int x = 4;
    int *p = NULL;
    my_subroutine();
    *p = 3;
    cout << x << ", " << *p << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- type run, and let it run to completion (really until it crashes)
- try the bt and f commands
- set up a break point at line 12, which is the line that is causing the crash
- type run, and confirm that you want to restart the program
- at the breakpoint, try printing out the value in p (p p); note that it is NULL
- set the p pointer, which is currently NULL, to point to a valud value (the int variable - x): expr p = &x
- enter c to let it continue running, and it should finish without crashing this time


### 远程调试
```
process connect connect://192.168.1.117:1234
```


###打印进程模块
```
image list -o -f
```
